## **We Hunt in the Shadows.**  

0wL OPS is a **powerful Bash-based offensive security toolkit** designed for:  
âœ… **Red Team Operators** â†’ Pre-exploitation recon, initial access, lateral movement.  
âœ… **Penetration Testers** â†’ Active & passive scanning, privilege escalation.  
âœ… **Bug Bounty Hunters** â†’ OSINT, web attack surface mapping, subdomain discovery.  
âœ… **Forensic Analysts** â†’ Threat hunting, adversary simulation.  

ðŸ¦‰ **0wL OPS automates reconnaissance, network analysis, exploitation, and persistence** in a highly modular and customizable way.

## Module Descriptions

### Reconnaissance & OSINT

- **Google Hacking:** Finds sensitive data indexed in search engines.
- **WHOIS & Passive DNS:** Gathers domain info and historical DNS data.
- **Metadata Extraction:** Extracts hidden metadata from documents.

### Network Scanning

- **ARP Scanning:** Identifies live hosts on the local network.
- **Nmap Discovery:** Comprehensive network scanning & fingerprinting.
- **Netcat Port Scanning:** Quick manual TCP scanning for reconnaissance.

### Exploitation & Evasion

- **Vim Escape:** Breaks out of restricted shells using Vim.
- **Rbash Escape:** Techniques to escape restricted shells.
- **MITM Attacks:** Man-in-the-middle attack simulation.

### Post-Exploitation & Forensics

- **Windows/Linux Command Cheatsheets:** Essential command-line references.
- **Credential Extraction:** Collects stored system credentials.
- **Threat Hunting:** Log analysis & detection of adversary activity.
